Orginial data have been screened for plausibility before data extraction. 
Unplausible values have been marked as missing in original data and are thus not included in the final dataset.

Soil temperature is extracted from following depths: 0,20,25,40,50,60,75,80,100,120,160,200,240,250,300,320,400,500,1000,1500,2000 cm
Each depth contains data measured at a range of depths, precisely:
Depths<500 cm: +- 3 cm
500 to <1000 cm: +- 5 cm
1000 cm to <1500 cm: +- 10 cm
>=1500 cm: +- 20 cm

For boreholes deeper than 500 cm, all temperature values measured at less than 200 cm are exluded.
